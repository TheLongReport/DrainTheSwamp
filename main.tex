\begin{abstract}
For decades, conservatives have decried the corruption embedded in government, calling for reform under the popular mantra ``Drain the Swamp.'' However, too often, this slogan has been reduced to mere calls for removing individuals from office, without addressing the systemic incentive structures that enable corruption to regenerate. This paper argues that the ``swamp'' is not merely a collection of corrupt actors but the oversized pool of government funds that inherently attracts corruption. Using formal logic, case studies from Michigan, and a rational deduction, this paper demonstrates that reducing taxes and government budgets is the only sustainable path to reducing corruption. It calls on voters, activists, and grassroots Republicans to pressure candidates and legislators to commit to reducing taxes and budgets—and to primary those who refuse. This paper also examines how legislators are co-opted by corporate and special interests, and proposes a grassroots strategy to reclaim influence through voter-based accountability.
